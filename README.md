## Overview
AI Wargame is a strategic 2-player game set on a 5x5 board, where an attacker and a defender engage in battle with various units. The goal is to destroy the defender's AI while protecting your own. This project involves implementing adversarial search algorithms to create challenging gameplay experiences.

## Features
- **Game Mechanics**: Implements a strategic board game with attacker and defender roles.
- **Adversarial Search**: Utilizes the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning for AI decision-making.
- **Heuristics**: Develops heuristics to enhance the AI's strategic decision-making process.
- **Manual and Automatic Play**: Supports both manual and automatic play modes for user flexibility.
- **Command-line Interface**: Provides a simple interface for interaction with text-based input/output.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Algorithms**: Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning
- **Development Environment**: Command-line interface

## Skills Demonstrated
- Artificial Intelligence
- Python Programming
- Algorithm Design
- Game Development
